The FreeNAS project welcomes all documentation contributions!
We're using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create this documentation website and the [Docsy theme](https://www.docsy.dev/) for general styling.

The tutorials in this section are designed to guide you with different kinds of documentation contributions.
Please feel free to propose changes and add new content here to help others learn how to contribute to project documentation!
