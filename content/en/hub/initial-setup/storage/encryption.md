# Encryption

Encrtypting a pool, follow the same process as creating a new pool, however you will need to check the **Encryption** option at the top of the page.

If desired, the encryption cypher can be changed.

# Keyfiles

Always back up the keyfile to a safe and secure location

<br><br>

To manually back up the pool keyfile, click the gear menu and select **Export Dataset Keys**

<br><br>

To change or update a Keyfile, click on the three dot menu (Options) and select **Encryption Options**.

<br><br>

Manually enter the key you wish to use or click **Generate Key**  for an autogenerated key.  Backup your keyfiles immediately after creating them.

To change from a Keyfile to a PassPhrase, click on the three dot menu (Options) and select **Encryption Options**.  Change the *Encryption Type* from `Key` to `Passphrase`

# Passphrase

<br><br>

**Encryption type**: How the dataset is secured. Choose between securing with an encryption Key or a user-defined Passphrase.

**Passphrase**: User-defined string used to decrypt the dataset. Can be used instead of an encryption key.
WARNING: the passphrase is the only means to decrypt the information stored in this dataset. Be sure to create a memorable passphrase or physically secure the passphrase.
Must be longer than 8 characters

**pbkdf2iters**: Number of password-based key derivation function 2 (PBKDF2) iterations to use for reducing vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Entering a number larger than 100000 is required. See PBKDF2 for more details.

If you change the ZFS encryption type from Key to Passphrase, you are still able to download the `dataset key` in the gear menu, however it will be blank.
If there is a way to disable this option when using a passphrase, it would probably be a good idea.  I can see in a large organization, different admin not being aware and not realizing that the downloads they made of the keyfile are blank (except for curly braces)
I'm not sure how aware the UI is of the method, but if this is possible we should disable it.
