# Encryption

To Encrtypt a pool follow the same process as creating a new pool.  In addition to the standard process, you will need to check the **Encryption** option at the top of the page.

Tthe encryption cypher can be changed if desired.

## Keyfiles

Always back up the keyfile to a safe and secure location.

<br><br>

Manually back up the pool keyfile by clicking the gear menu and selecting **Export Dataset Keys**.

<br><br>

Changing or updating the Keyfile is accomplished by clicking on the three dot menu (Options) and selecting **Encryption Options**.

Manually enter the key you wish to use or click **Generate Key**  for an autogenerated key.  Backup your keyfiles immediately after creating them.

## Passphrase

Changing from a Keyfile to a PassPhrase is accomplished by clicking on the three dot menu (Options) and selecting **Encryption Options**.  Change the *Encryption Type* from `Key` to `Passphrase`

<br><br>

**Encryption type**: How the dataset is secured. Choose between securing with an encryption Key or a user-defined Passphrase.

**Passphrase**: User-defined string used to decrypt the dataset. Can be used instead of an encryption key.
WARNING: the passphrase is the only means to decrypt the information stored in this dataset. Be sure to create a memorable passphrase or physically secure the passphrase.
Must be longer than 8 characters

**pbkdf2iters**: Number of password-based key derivation function 2 (PBKDF2) iterations to use for reducing vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Entering a number larger than 100000 is required. See PBKDF2 for more details.


## Locking and Unlocking Datasets

Datasets can only be locked and unlocked if they are secured with a passphrase instead of a keyfile.
Before locking a  dataset, verify that it is not currently in use.  Then click the three dot option menu and click **Lock**.

<br><br>

Confirm the popup to lock the dataset.  Force unmount only if you are certain that no one is currently accessing the dataset.

<br><br>

A dialog window will remain visible while the dataset is locked.

<br><br>

Once the dataset has been successfully locked, the unlock icon will change to a locked icon.  While the dataset is locked, it is not available for use.

To Unlock a dataset click the three dot menu and click **Unlock**

<br><br>

Enter the passphrase and click **Submit**.  If there are child datasets that are locked with the same passphrase you can unlock them all at the same time by checking the *Unlock Children* checkbox.

<br><br>

Confirm that you wish to unlock the datasets.

<br><br>

When the datasets have been successfully unlocked a dialog box will appear stating success.

The dataset listing will now show the unlocked icon.

## Conversion from GELI

It is not possible to convert an existing GELI encrypted pool to use Native ZFS Encryption, however data can be migrated from the GELI encrypted Pool. A new pool of the same size must be created and encrypted with the new Native ZFS Encryption.  Once a pool of the same size exists, the data can the data can be migrated with ZFS send.
