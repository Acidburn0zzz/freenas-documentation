    <th class="tg-wp8o" colspan="2"><p class="box-centered">TrueNAS is a storage operating system that is designed to be the most effective and time-efficient solution for handling and sharing data over a network. It is the simplest way to create a safe, centralized, and easily accessible place for your data. The operating system can be installed on virtually any hardware platform and is suitable for home, small business, and enterprise applications.</p><br></th>

    <td class="tg-73oq"><img src="/images/Openzfs.png" class="center" style="width:15.5%;height:auto;"><br><h2 class="text-center">OpenZFS for Maximum Protection and Performance</h2><br>TrueNAS leverages the enterprise-grade OpenZFS file system to provide an all-inclusive data management solution that is designed for decades of continual use. To provide the perfect balance between total storage size and data redundancy, data storage pools can be configured in a variety of RAID or Mirrored configurations. Pools can even be expanded later when new disks are added to the system, allowing your storage environment to grow with your storage solutions.<br>ZFS focuses on protecting your data with features like Copy-on-Write and 2-Copy Metadata. Automated data replication can keep your most valuable information safe in a remote storage location and fast resilvering times mean that if a disk fails, a replacement disk can be quickly integrated into the degraded data storage pool. ZFS uses an innovative snapshot and cloning system to maximize available space, as well as in-line data compression, thin provisioning, and deduplication.</td>
    <td class="tg-73oq"><img src="/images/security-icon.png" class="center" style="width:15.1%;height:auto;"><br><h2 class="text-center">Security-focused for Your Peace of Mind</h2><br> TrueNAS supports a variety of security solutions. You can configure self-encrypted drives (SEDs) or use ZFS native encryption to secure your data. Access control lists are fully customizable and provide another layer of protection for sensitive data. TrueNAS is FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified and installs with secure defaults in place, like using encryption for file transfers and disabling SSH. Local users and groups can be managed, along with integrating TrueNAS with LDAP, Active Directory, Kerberos, and NIS.</td>

    <td class="tg-73oq"><img src="/images/unified-networking.png" class="center" style="width:11.5%;height:auto;"><br><h2 class="text-center">Sharing Your Data has Never Been Easier</h2><br> TrueNAS supports all the prominent network file sharing and remote backup options, and can even be expanded with applications from FreeBSD or Linux. Supported sharing protocols include NFS versions 3 and 4, SMB versions 1,2,3, and 4, AFP, FTP, WebDAV, and rsync. TrueNAS fully supports Block sharing and has been certified for use with vSphere, Citrix, and Veeam. Want to securely import or back up data with a Cloud Storage Provider? No problem! TrueNAS can even automate these tasks according to your ideal schedule.</td>
    <td class="tg-73oq"><img src="/images/TrueCommand.png" class="center" style="width:56%;height:auto;"><br><h2 class="text-center">TrueCommand Provides Scaled Management</h2><br> Scaling up with several TrueNAS systems or looking to fine-tune system access? TrueCommand takes the guesswork out of multi-TrueNAS management by centralizing system alerts, reports, and analytics in one easy to use interface. It include users and teams with role-based access control and a robust auditing system so that you can control who has access to a system, what can be changed on that system, and a full log of every TrueNAS configuration change.</td>
